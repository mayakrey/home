    <p>
      I’m a software engineer from Berlin with a passion
      and good eye for design and usability.

      After having gained years of experience creating a wide variety of products including frontends, backends and
      infrastructure as code, I decided to broaden my horizon by traveling around Latin America for a year.

      Now I’m back and ready for new coding challenges. Preferably in the JavaScript world. In the meantime I like to
      stay up to date with private projects, learning about new technologies like flutter vue.
